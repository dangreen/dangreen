## About Me

Hi! My name is Daniil, and I am a developer with over 10 years of experience. Most of my production experience is related to creating websites and applications using React.js. Another part of my experience involves creating, maintaining, and improving frontend project infrastructure (build systems, development tools, testing, CI/CD, etc.). An important aspect of my experience is also Open Source: I am a contributor to several projects and have created a few of my own.

I keep up with new technologies and try to apply them in my work. I periodically share my experience through articles and conference talks.

I love creating optimized and accessible interfaces, maintaining project infrastructure, and I am very skilled at refactoring code.

## Hobbies

- Love my cats: a sphynx named Miguel and a Cornish Rex named Marsik
- Collect gaming consoles and games for them
- Modify old gaming consoles
- Sometimes I play computer games
- Love building Lego
- Team Spirit fan üêâ
- Go to the gym

## How I Got Into Programming

In the summer of 2008, my mom sent me to the ["Summer School of Young Programmers"](https://www.iis.nsk.su/edu/school). Since I was not familiar with programming, I was placed in the workshop for the youngest kids. There, I was introduced to the programming language [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/about). I quickly mastered it and realized that I enjoyed programming. I attended the Summer School for the next two summers as well, but without any significant achievements. It became clear that I needed to come prepared, so my mom hired a tutor for me. This tutor was not a computer science teacher but a programmer who wrote software for enterprises using Delphi and tutored on the side. We started learning the basics of Pascal and then moved on to Delphi, where I was very excited to create my first application with a user interface.

Back in 2008, at the Summer School, I learned that besides Windows, there was also Linux, and Apple made not only iPods and iPhones but also computers with their own OS. As a budding geek, I tried various Linux distributions on my own. But one day, I came across a video of a guy installing Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard on, I believe, his Dell laptop. This marked the beginning of my journey into the world of Hackintosh. It wasn't successful on the first try, but I eventually installed Mac OS on my PC.

While studying Delphi, I was eager to apply my knowledge to write a program for Mac OS. I found [Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/) ‚Äî a cross-platform open-source alternative to Delphi. Lazarus was very similar to Delphi, and we continued my lessons using it. Soon, our sessions ended as I had learned the basics, and I began to study what interested me on my own. I was interested in creating a website/repository with kexts (kernel extensions, drivers in Mac OS) for Hackintosh. I decided to build the server-side part using PHP. The site for browsing the catalog was without JS, just HTML and CSS. I had already studied some HTML at the Summer School, and I learned PHP and CSS on the go: if I needed to do something, I searched on Google and did it. In Lazarus, I created a program to populate the kext database. Initially, the database was an XML file on an FTP server, but later I started learning and implementing MySQL. At some point, I wanted to make the site more interactive, so I began learning JS. Before going to camp in 2011, I reviewed the list of workshops, and my choice fell on the Qt development workshop. I decided to see what it was about ‚Äî and soon, the program for populating the repository was being rewritten in Qt. I never finished the kext repository, but I gained enough knowledge to start freelancing.
